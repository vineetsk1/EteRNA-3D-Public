         DSSR: a software program for Defining the Secondary
         Structures of RNA from three-dimensional coordinates
        v1.0.1-2014jan31, by Xiang-Jun Lu (xiangjun@x3dna.org)

   This program is actively maintained and developed. As always, I
   greatly appreciate your feedback! Please report all DSSR-related
   issues on the 3DNA Forum (http://forum.x3dna.org/). I strive to
   respond promptly to *any* questions posted there.

****************************************************************************
Note: Each nucleotide is identified by model:chainId.name#, where the
      'model:' portion is omitted if no model number is available as
      is normally the case for X-ray crystal structures in the PDB. So
      a common example would be like A.G19, meaning G #19 on chain A.
      One-letter base names for modified nucleotides are put in lower
      case (e.g., 'c' for 5MC). For further information about the
      output notation, please run DSSR with the '-note' option. More
      details can be found in the DSSR user manual. Questions and
      suggestions are always welcome on the 3DNA Forum.

List of 1 lone WC/wobble pair
  Note: lone WC/wobble pairs are assigned negative indices to differentiate
        them from the stem numbers, which are positive.

Note: for the various types of loops listed below, numbers within the first
      set of brackets are the number of loop nts, and numbers in the second
      set of brackets are the identities of the stems (positive number) or
      lone WC/wobble pairs (negative numbers) to which they are linked.
