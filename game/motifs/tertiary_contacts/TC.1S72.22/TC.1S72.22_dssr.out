         DSSR: a software program for Defining the Secondary
         Structures of RNA from three-dimensional coordinates
        v1.0.1-2014jan31, by Xiang-Jun Lu (xiangjun@x3dna.org)

   This program is actively maintained and developed. As always, I
   greatly appreciate your feedback! Please report all DSSR-related
   issues on the 3DNA Forum (http://forum.x3dna.org/). I strive to
   respond promptly to *any* questions posted there.

****************************************************************************
Note: Each nucleotide is identified by model:chainId.name#, where the
      'model:' portion is omitted if no model number is available as
      is normally the case for X-ray crystal structures in the PDB. So
      a common example would be like A.G19, meaning G #19 on chain A.
      One-letter base names for modified nucleotides are put in lower
      case (e.g., 'c' for 5MC). For further information about the
      output notation, please run DSSR with the '-note' option. More
      details can be found in the DSSR user manual. Questions and
      suggestions are always welcome on the 3DNA Forum.

List of 1 helix
  Note: a helix is defined by base-stacking interactions, regardless of bp
        type and backbone connectivity, and may contain more than one stem.
      helix#number[stems-contained] bps=number-of-base-pairs in the helix
      bp-type: '|' for a canonical WC/wobble pair, '.' otherwise
      helix-form: classification of a dinucleotide step comprising the bp
        above the given designation and the bp that follows it. Types
        include 'A', 'B' or 'Z' for the common A-, B- and Z-form helices,
        '.' for an unclassified step, and 'x' for a step without a
        continuous backbone.
